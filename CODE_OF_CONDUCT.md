Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
Our Pledge
As members, contributors, and leaders, we commit to fostering a harassment-free environment for everyone in our community. This includes respect for individuals regardless of their age, body size, disability (visible or invisible), ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, experience level, education, socio-economic status, nationality, appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

We aim to act in ways that promote an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

Our Standards

Respect for Differences: Acknowledge and appreciate differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
Constructive Feedback: Provide and accept feedback graciously.
Accountability: Own up to mistakes, apologize sincerely, and learn from experiences.
